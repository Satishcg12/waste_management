                As the principal of Samriddhi School, I am proud to say that our Zero Waste Project is an
                environmentally friendly initiative that helps our community become free from waste. Our students have
                learned that this is one of the most effective methods of waste management, and they have even started
                segregating their waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable at home. This project is a great
                example of how small steps can make a big difference in protecting our environment. Together, we can
                transform the world one step at a time. From waste to wonder!

                    The zero-waste project is all about recycling, reusing, and reducing waste materials into something
                    useful. I learned to separate the non-biodegradable and biodegradable waste. As a zero-waste leader,
                    I check if my friends are not wasting their food and make sure that they leave with a clean plate. I
                    never waste my food or dirty my surroundings. I also shared with my family members the importance of
                    keeping our environment clean. At home, I help my mom make manure out of our kitchen waste.

                    The zero-waste project is one of the most important projects we are implementing at the school. It
                    is an activity to protect our environment. I learned that we can create useful things out of waste,
                    even kitchen waste. As a leader, I donâ€™t allow anyone to waste their food. At home, I also encourage
                    my siblings not to waste whatever they have on their plate. We also separate the biodegradable and
                    non-biodegradable wastes at home. Out of the biodegradable waste, we produced manure and used it on
                    our farm.

                    am happy that we are learning this at school because even at home we started segregating our waste
                    into biodegradable and non-biodegradable.

                    &quot;Greetings! I&#39;m Aman Sitaula, an 8th-grade student at Manaslu, and I
                    proudly serve as a Zero Waste Leader. Today, I&#39;m excited to provide you
                    with insights into the remarkable Zero Waste Project.
                    The Zero Waste Project is a pioneering initiative undertaken by
                    Samriddhi School, renowned for its excellence in daily waste
                    management. This project draws its inspiration from the noble cause of
                    environmental conservation. We take the leftover food from our
                    school&#39;s canteen, and under the guidance of our dedicated Zero Waste
                    Leaders, we ensure that this waste is thoughtfully disposed of in
                    designated pits.
                    We are passionate about spreading the concept of zero waste at home,
                    highlighting the significance of organic waste, which is a boon for the
                    health of plants and flowers, among other things. Thanks to these
                    initiatives, our school has made impressive strides in effectively
                    handling the everyday kitchen waste. The compost generated from this
                    project finds a valuable purpose in nurturing plants and vegetables,
                    fostering the protection of our environment and, in turn, contributing
                    to the preservation of our precious Earth.
                    Join us on this journey to a greener, more sustainable future. Together,
                    we can make a lasting impact!&quot;

                    src="/assets/testimonials/satkar.jpeg">
                    &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Satkar Sapkota, a current 10th-grade student at Samriddhi
                    School, and I&#39;m excited to share my experiences with the Zero Waste
                    Project. First, let me introduce what the Zero Waste Project entails.
                    Zero waste involves efficiently managing the waste produced in our
                    daily lives, including kitchen scraps like vegetable peels, unwanted parts
                    of vegetables or fruits, and dried leaves from trees. Kitchen waste and
                    dried leaves are categorized as &#39;greens&#39; and &#39;browns,&#39; which are rich in
                    nitrogen, essential for promoting healthy plant growth.
                    However, the Zero Waste Project is not just about managing waste that
                    can be converted into valuable compost. It also requires proper
                    guidance and support from dedicated leaders in the zero-waste
                    movement. Our school&#39;s principal, Mr. Naresh Prasad Shrestha,
                    introduced this initiative to all students. We were encouraged to
                    segregate waste into degradable and non-degradable categories in our
                    homes, and whenever possible, to compost the waste ourselves.
                    The Zero Waste Project isn&#39;t solely focused on creating compost and
                    distributing it to consumers; it&#39;s also designed to protect the
                    environment. By reducing waste at its source, we contribute to a
                    significant decrease in pollution.
                    Through this project, students have discovered the hidden value in
                    everyday waste and its crucial role in environmental conservation.
